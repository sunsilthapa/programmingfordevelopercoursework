package Question1;//Answer using java with comments. Assume you were hired to create an application
// for an ISP, and there is n number of network devices, such as routers, that are
// linked together to provides internet access to home user users. You are given a
// 2D array that represents network connections between these network devices such that a[i]=[xi,yi]
// where xi is connected to yi device.  Suppose there is a power outage on a certain device provided
// as int n represents id of the device on which power failure occurred)), Write an algorithm
// to return impacted network devices due to breakage of the link between network devices.
// These impacted device list assists you notify linked consumers that there is a power outage
// and it will take some time to rectify an issue.
// Note that: node 0 will always represent a source of internet or gateway to international network..
//
//        Input: edges= {{0,1}, {0,2}, {1,3}, {1,6}, {2,4}, {4,6}, {4,5}, {5,7}}
//        Target Device (On which power Failure occurred): 4
//        Output (Impacted Device List) = {5,7}
//        Explanation: power failure on network device 4 will disconnect 5 and 7 from internet
